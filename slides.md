# function components

##

The last day in class we created all our components by creating
classes like this:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <li>this is my component</li>;
  }
}
```

##

However, React provides an easier way for rendering components when we
don't need them to handle special state.  These kind of components is
called function components:

```javascript
const MyComponent = (props) => (
  <li>this is my component</li>
);
```

##

Let's see an example (example1).

# Single Page Applications

##

A SPA is an application that re-renders the HTML code dynamically in
the client side instead of letting the server render it.

##

They made snappier applications because we don't need to always wait
for the server to re-render HTML for each new page.

## How do they render different components?

##

With client side routing!

# React router

##

React router is a community project (not created by the React team @
FB) that integrates very nicely with React.

##

It has three main components

- The `Router`
- `Routes`
- `Links`

# Router

##

We need to wrap the components that will use routing in the `BrowserRouter`.

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter><MyComponent /></BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById('root'));
```

This will allow us to use routing inside this component

# Routes 

`<Route path="/about-us" component={MyComponent}/>`

##

Routes make it possible to handle different URLs. They have two main props:

- `path`: the URL this route will match
- `component`: The component to be rendered when the path matches


## exact

There will be times in which more than one route matches a URL.  See example2.

## exact

`exact` will help us rendering certain components when the URL match is **EXACT**.

## matching dynamic paths

At some point we may want to extract some data from a path.  Think of
URLs like:

- `users/pepegar`
- `clients/5133525`

In these cases we can capture some variable from the path and pass it
to the rendered component.

## matching dynamic paths

We do so as follows:

```javascript
<Route path="/clients/:clientId" component={Client} />
```

## matching dynamic paths

The match data from the route is passed as a prop to the rendered
component.

Whe can use the actual value from the path in the target component as
follows:

```javascript
const Client = (props) => (
  <div>rendering client: {props.match.params.clientId}</div>
);
```

# Links

##

we use `<Link />` to add a link to other parts of our application.


##

There's only one important `prop` in the `<Link` component, `to`:

```javascript
<Link to="/users/pepegar" />
```

Mind the leading slash in the path.
